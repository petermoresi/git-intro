* What is Git?

  - Git is a *version control system*
  - Git operates in a *filesystem*; and requires no server infrastructure
  - Git is entirely offline (there is no server)
  - Git is an advanced file synchronization utility
  - Git experience is similar to a traditional VCS (e.g. CVS, SVN, TFS, ect...) when a server stores the /master/ copy.

* Why choose Git?

  - HUGE user community
  - Distributed computing typically offers better performance then centralized systems like SVN and TFS.
  - Social networks like https://github.com, https://bitbucket.org/ and https://about.gitlab.com/
    - Secure, private repos for a fee
    - Issue tracking, wiki and release management tools
    - Web based reporting and file viewing
    - More...
  - Graphical tools are available for Windows and Mac
    - Github for [[https://windows.github.com/][Windows]] / [[https://mac.github.com/][Mac]] work with any Git repo (not just the ones they host)
    - [[https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/][Atlassian SourceTree]] works great on Windows/Mac
    - Even Visual Studio/TFS work with Git
    - There are dozens of free and commercial options available
  - Like SVN/TFS; Git offers a command-line interface to automate processes
